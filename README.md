# PHP-First-Project

### About

"PHP-First-Project" was a project made as a final independent project for the subject named "The basics of making PHP applications" (Osnove 
izrade PHP aplikacija) on the Croatian Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (Fakultet elektrotehnike i raƒçunarstva).

The purpose of this project was to obtain deep understanding of fundamental concepts used in PHP. Concepts covered by this project
vary from basic ones (functions, arrays, forms, sessions...) up to more advanced ones (regular expressions, object-oriented programming,
MVC software architecture, database communication...). 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To be able to run this application you will need to set up your PHP development environment. To do so, you will need to install PHP, 
Web server and MySQL server. You can install them separately or you can install all-in-one package like 
[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). It bundles PHP, Apache Web server and MySQL server as well as few other tools. 

### Configuration

To be able to start this application you will need to create database named "ssp", set database user name to "root" and set database 
password to "12345678". If you do not wish to use those values you can change them directly in the application to match the values that are 
already set in your local environment. File name where those values can be changed is "PHP-First-Project/app/services/DBRepository.php".

### Browser Recommendation

It is recommended to run this application with google chrome. Since the main purpose of this project was to demonstrate PHP knowledge,
it has not been tested on other browsers except google chrome. If you don't use google chrome, you might experience some visual
inconsistencies.
